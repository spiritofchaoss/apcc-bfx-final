# Proposal for final project AS.410.712.82.SP22

I want to formulate a project around the application Rosetta. Rosetta is a modeling software for macromolecular structures. 
I will be using their de novo structure prediction software. 
For my final project I will pre run some amino acid sequence through the Rosetta de novo structure application. 
The analysis will provide some information on structure prediction. The output will yield:
    Pdb file- protein structural information
    Silent file- proteins structural information in Rosetta format
    Score file- scores
    Log file- log of output
I will have the analysis results saved inside a mysql table such as some information from pdb file and score file. 
There will be a CSS/HTML/Javascript page that allows users to input protein of choice (from a selected few). 
Then, the response will search through the file for results based off criteriaâ€™s such as score, rms, weights, residue, etc.. 
It will auto populate results for whatever the user searched.
